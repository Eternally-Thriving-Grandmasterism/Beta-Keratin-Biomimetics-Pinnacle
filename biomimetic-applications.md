## β-Keratin Biomimetic Applications Lattice

1. Lightweight Composites: Hierarchical nanofibrils → aerospace frames (Starship), crash structures (Tesla)
   Edge: 30–50% better strength-to-weight in impact

2. Self-Assembling Scaffolds: pH/temperature-triggered peptides → tissue engineering, wound healing
   Benefit: Biocompatible, tunable degradation

3. Adaptive Materials: Anisotropic stiffness → soft actuators (Optimus), performance fabrics (Powrush™)
   Advantage: Passive directional response

4. Abrasion Coatings: Tough cortex mimic → heat shields, exterior panels
   Edge: Self-healing microcracks

5. Energy-Absorbing Structures: Sacrificial interfaces → battery protection, exoskeleton padding
   Advantage: High toughness at low density
