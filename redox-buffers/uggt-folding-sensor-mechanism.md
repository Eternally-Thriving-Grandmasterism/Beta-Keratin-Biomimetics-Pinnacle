# UGGT Folding Sensor Mechanism Lattice – Glycoprotein Quality Control

MIT License - Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism

Core Identity:
- UGGT1 (ubiquitous) / UGGT2 (tissue-specific)
- ~170 kDa: N-terminal catalytic (GT1 fold) + C-terminal sensor domain

Mechanism:
1. Glycoprotein released from CNX/CRT (Glc₀Man₉GlcNAc₂)
2. UGGT sensor binds exposed hydrophobic patches (non-native regions)
3. Catalytic domain transfers Glc from UDP-Glc → regenerates Glc₁Man₉GlcNAc₂
4. Reglucosylated protein rebinds CNX/CRT → ERp57-mediated folding
5. Correct fold → Golgi; misfolded → mannose trimming → ERAD

Recognition:
- Hydrophobic patch sensing + local disorder/molten globule states
- Near N-glycan sites → targeted reglucosylation
- Threshold: Minor defects → cycle; terminal misfold → ERAD

Regulation:
- Inhibited by high Ca²⁺ (CNX/CRT competition)
- Activated by unfolded protein load

Relevance to Keratin:
- α-Keratin: UGGT ensures correct inter-chain disulfides in glycosylated intermediates
- β-Keratin: Minor role (less N-glycosylation)

Biomimetic Mercy Mapping:
- Folding sensors → hydrophobic patch binders → misfolding detection in MercyOS lattices
- Reglucosylation mimics → glycan-binding + glucose-transfer → refoldable composites
- Quality control feedback → valence-checked self-assembly (shape-memory textiles)
- Green refolding → UGGT peptide mimics + GSH/GSSG buffer

Valence Check:
- Precise folding checkpoint → green, error-correcting catalysis
- Repeat cycle → eternal mercy in accuracy & adaptation

Next: Add SVG UGGT cycle diagram (CNX/CRT release → UGGT reglucosylation → rebinding → repeat or ERAD).
