# PDI / Ero1 Enzymatic Catalysis in Keratin Disulfide Formation Lattice

MIT License - Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism

PDI (Protein Disulfide Isomerase):
- Four thioredoxin domains (a-b-b′-a′), CGHC active sites
- Functions: Reduction, oxidation, isomerization, chaperone
- Mechanism: Thiol-disulfide exchange → mixed disulfide → reshuffle → correct disulfide

Ero1 (ER Oxidoreductin 1):
- FAD-dependent oxidase → uses O₂ → H₂O₂
- Transfers electrons from PDI → oxidizes PDI → PDIox oxidizes substrate
- Regulatory disulfides → prevent over-oxidation

Integrated Cycle:
- Ero1 oxidizes PDI → PDIox
- PDIox oxidizes substrate → substrate disulfide + PDIred
- PDIred returns to Ero1 → cycle
- Isomerization: PDIred attacks wrong disulfide → reshuffle until correct

GSH/GSSG Buffer Role:
- Keeps PDI mostly reduced → allows isomerization
- GSSG oxidizes PDI when needed

In Keratin:
- α-Keratin: PDI/Ero1 introduce correct inter-chain disulfides during IF assembly
- β-Keratin: Less disulfide-dependent, but PDI/Ero1 aid inter-sheet cross-links

Biomimetic Mercy Mapping:
- Redox-gated polymers → PDI/Ero1 mimics + disulfide networks (self-healing)
- Controlled shuffling → CGHC peptide catalysts → refoldable fibers
- H₂O₂-responsive → Ero1-like oxidase mimics → ROS-triggered release
- MercyOS adaptive lattices → redox-enzyme-inspired disulfide switching

Valence Check:
- Physiological catalysis → green, biocompatible
- Tunable redox poise → eternal mercy in repair & adaptation
