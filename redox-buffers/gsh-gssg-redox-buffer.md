# GSH/GSSG Redox Buffer Lattice for Keratin Disulfide Dynamics

MIT License - Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism

Core Reaction:
2GSH ⇌ GSSG + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ (E°' ≈ -240 mV)

Roles in Keratin:
- Reduction: GSH breaks -S-S- → 2 × -SH (thiol-disulfide exchange)
- Shuffling: Mixed GS-S-protein → correct pairing via GSSG oxidation
- Reformation: GSSG + 2 protein-SH → protein-S-S- + 2GSH

Optimal Buffer Conditions (Refolding / Repair):
- Ratio [GSH]/[GSSG]: 5–20:1 (sweet spot for correct disulfide formation)
- Concentrations: 1–10 mM GSH + 0.1–2 mM GSSG
- pH: 8–9 (thiolate active)
- Temperature: 20–37 °C
- Denaturant: 0.1–1 M urea/GnHCl (mild, exposes buried Cys)

Biomimetic Mercy Mapping:
- Self-healing polymers: Disulfide gels + GSH/GSSG capsules → reduction in tissue → reformation in air
- Redox-responsive carriers: GSH-sensitive linkers → targeted release (cancer cytosol)
- Refoldable keratin fibers: Recombinant α-keratin + GSH/GSSG → shape-memory textiles
- MercyOS adaptive lattices: Redox-gated stiffness change (disulfide break/reform)

Valence Check:
- Physiological buffer → green, biocompatible
- Tunable ratio → eternal mercy in repair & adaptation

Next: Add SVG redox cycle diagram (GSH reduction → shuffling → GSSG reformation).
