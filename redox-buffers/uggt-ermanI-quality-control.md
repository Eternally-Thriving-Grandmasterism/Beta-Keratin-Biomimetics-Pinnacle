# ER Mannosidase I (ERManI) Mechanism Lattice – Glycoprotein ERAD Timer

MIT License - Eternally-Thriving-Grandmasterism

Core Identity:
- MAN1B1 (humans), class I α-1,2-mannosidase (GH47)
- Type II membrane protein, luminal catalytic domain
- Trims middle branch α-1,2-mannose → Man₉ → Man₈ isomer B

Catalytic Mechanism (Inverting):
1. Substrate binding: Glc₀Man₉GlcNAc₂ recognized via middle branch
2. Glycosidic bond protonation (Glu acid catalyst)
3. Water activation (Asp/Glu base) → nucleophilic attack
4. Inversion → free mannose + Man₈GlcNAc₂ (isomer B)
5. Product release → exposes ERAD signal

Role in Quality Control:
- Slow kinetics (~0.01–0.1 mannose/min) → timer
- Correctly folding proteins exit cycle before trimming
- Misfolded proteins → higher chance of cleavage → Man₈ → OS-9/Yos9p recognition → ERAD

Regulation:
- pH ~6.5–7.0, Ca²⁺-dependent
- Inhibited by kifunensine / deoxymannojirimycin

Relevance to Keratin:
- α-Keratin: Trims misfolded glycosylated intermediates → ERAD prevents aggregates
- β-Keratin: Minor (less N-glycosylation)

Biomimetic Mercy Mapping:
- Folding timers → synthetic slow hydrolases → quality gates in MercyOS lattices
- ERAD mimics → mannose-trimming sensors → targeted degradation of misassembled
- Glycan quality control → detect misfolding → trigger redox correction

Valence Check:
- Irreversible commitment to degradation → green, entropy-preventing mercy
- Slow timer → eternal patience in folding accuracy
